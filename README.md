# EduID iOS
[![Carthage compatible](https://img.shields.io/badge/Carthage-compatible-4BC51D.svg?style=flat)](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage)

The main iOS native mobile app for EduID-Mobile project. This app will act as an authorization provider and provides authorization service(EduID) to the iPhone user.

EduID iOS performs identically like the [EduID Android](https://github.com/EduID-Mobile/EduID-Android). The only different thing from these two apps are the way they communicate through the other app. This topic is explained more clearly in the specification of the [NAIL API](https://github.com/EduID-Mobile/Architecture-and-Requirements/blob/master/40-nail-api.md).

For its function this app depends on the [JWTSwift Framework](https://github.com/EduID-Mobile/JWTswift). Developer could include this framework easily at the first installation with the help of carthage.
